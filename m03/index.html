<h1><em>the cottage garden</em></h1>


  <p><i>The cottage garden</i> <em>is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</em></p>

  <p><em>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>English estate gardens.</u></em></p>

  <p><em>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</em></p>
